## C Sorter

#### Description
Create ascending and descending ordered arrays using C with a fast and unique hybrid sorting algorithm.

- All integral data types supported
- Allocates memory without dynamic memory allocation functions
- Allows freeing 5-16 bytes of unreferenced variable memory after first loop pass
- Approximately 3x faster than bubble sort with 5x fewer loop iterations
- Compiles with forward-compatible `C89`
- Conforms to strict ISO C with `-pedantic-errors` enabled
- Efficient without multithreading or processor-specific vectorization
- Fast sorting speed without relying on compiler optimization
- Memory-safe with defined behavior
- Minified and readable code with single-letter variable names
- More optimal alternative to merge sort, quicksort and novel sorting algorithms
- No mean or median numbers calculated
- No recursive subfunctions
- No redundant merged numbers in memory
- Optimal for large inputs
- Optimal for both pre-sorted best cases and shuffled worst cases
- Predetermined high and low numbers not required
- Reverses pre-sorted order in a single loop pass
- Variants for both signed and unsigned data types
- Variants for both ascending and descending sort order

#### Usage
In development.
